							<p style="color: #000000;">For Park, who resides in GMT+9, the distribution of mandatory Columbia College underclassman seminars&mdash;Literature Humanities, Frontiers of Science, University Writing, and Contemporary Civilization&mdash;over the day saw little change from the pre-COVID-19 spring 2020 semester to post-COVID-19 semesters. </p>
						</div>


						<div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='1'>
							<p style="color: #000000;">While classes that end around 12 p.m. EST and 12 a.m. GMT+9 accommodates both American and many international students, the college has provided few classes in that time period. </p>
						</div>

						<div class='step' data-width='50%' data-index='2'>
							<p style="color: #000000;">Compared to the pre-COVID spring semester, Columbia College added only five Core seminar sections that ended between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. GMT+9 time to the spring 2021 semester. </p>
						</div>

						<div class='step' data-width='10%' data-index='3'>
							<p style="color: #000000;">The distribution of major requirement courses is even more unaccommodating to the majority of international students than that of mandatory Core seminars, with more classes ending between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. GMT+9 than in any other time frame</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step' data-width='90%' data-index='4'>
							<p style="color: #000000;">The distribution of all courses mirrors the distribution of major requirement classes.</p>
